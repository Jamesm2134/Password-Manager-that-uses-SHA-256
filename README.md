Password-Manager-that-uses-SHA-256
A password manager that uses SHA-256 will secure users passwords in a safe environment that
is only accessible via a master password. SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a
cryptographic hash function that creates a unique, irreversible 256-bit hash value from any length
of input data. The program will store the user info in the code and only give the user its
passwords back if it presents the correct masterkey given to them at the time of entering the
passwords.

Functions:
Program will not have UI/GUI. It will be based in the terminal
- C#
- User enters password
- Program stores password
- User given masterkey
- Program only releases passwords if correct masterkey is entered into terminal
